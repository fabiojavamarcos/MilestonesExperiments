Also I just feel like most of the skills that were matched were the same issue. I wouldn't say they were wrong but I also wouldn't say it helped me want to contribute to a project more. I did like the front end look! I think it is a great idea but to send me into the right direction of wanting to contribute I would need documentation of where to look to contribute. Also a simple fix I was putting in the url https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI/issues and it wouldn't accept that it would only accept https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI. So maybe just a simple cut down to the root folder. Thank you guys, great idea I hope this helps!"
