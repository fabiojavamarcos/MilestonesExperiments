Purpose: Thank you for participating in the survey. The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the process of onboarding newcomers to a project and to understand how to make onboarding easier for newcomers to a project.

Please fill out the short survey, which may take less than 5 minutes. We are recruiting eligible participants for a contribution experiment. We will offer a $25 gift card for the experiment participants. You will be asked if you want to be included in the 1 hour long contribution experiment upon completion of our survey. To be included in the contribution experiment, you need to provide your e-mail address (which will be used only for the call for the contribution experiment). 

 

In the contribution experiment, we would like to observe you while using Integrated Development Environment (IDE) tools. The purpose of this observation is to give us an idea of which features enable comparative problem solving during programming tasks and to potentially inform future improvements on these tools. The results of this study may be used for fulfilling student dissertations and academic publications. This project is funded by National Science Foundation (NSF).

 

Activities: The study activities include observing you using IDE tools to accomplish a set of tasks and completing a questionnaire before and after this process. We will audio-record and screen capture your actions for transcription purposes. If you are not willing to be audio-recorded or have your actions screen captured, please do not participate. The session is expected to run for approximately one hour. 

 
Benefits: There are no direct benefits for participating in the study. However, the study may help improve the usability of IDE tools.

 

Confidentiality: It is possible that others could learn that you participated in this study but the information you provide will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law. However, federal government regulatory agencies, NSF, and the Oregon State University Institutional Review Board (a committee that reviews and approves research studies involving human subjects) may inspect and copy records pertaining to this research. It is possible that these records could contain information that personally identifies you. To help protect your confidentiality, we will identify your data only by code number, and records tying you to the code number will be destroyed after data collection for the study. All data will be stored in a secure location.


 

Voluntary: Participation in this study is voluntary. You can skip any of the questions that you do not wish to answer. Your participation or non participation will not have an impact on your relationship with the university or your job. 

 

Compensation: We will offer $25/session for your time on completion of the study

 

Study contacts: If you have any questions about this research project, please contact Dr. Anita Sarma, at (541) 737-5985 or by email at anita.sarma@oregonstate.edu. If you have questions about your rights or welfare as a participant, please contact the Oregon State University Institutional Review Board (IRB) Office, at (541) 737-8008 or by email at IRB@oregonstate.edu.
