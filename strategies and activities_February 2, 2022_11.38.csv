Researchers: Marco A. Gerosa, PhD (Northern Arizona University), Igor Steinmacher, PhD (Northern Arizona University),  Igor Wiese, PhD (UTFPR), Fabio Santos, MSc. 

Purpose: Thank you for participating in the survey. The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the process of onboarding newcomers to a project and to understand how to make onboarding easier for the newcomers to a project. Parts of the results of the study will be used to help a student researchers’ thesis or dissertation completion. This study is funded by the National Science Foundation.

Please fill out the short survey which may take about 7 minutes and we will raffle several $25 gift-cards. You will be asked if you want to be included in the raffle upon completion of our survey. To be included in the raffle, you need to provide your e-mail address (which will be used only for the raffle). 

Confidentiality: The security and confidentiality of information collected from you online cannot be guaranteed. Confidentiality will be kept to the extent permitted by the technology being used. Information collected online can be intercepted, corrupted, lost, destroyed, arrive late or incomplete or contain viruses.


Voluntary: Participation in this study is voluntary. You are free to decide not to participate or to withdraw at any time. You can skip questions you prefer not to answer. 

Study contacts: If you have any questions about this research project, please contact: ‘anita.sarma@oregonstate.edu'. If you have questions about your rights or welfare as a participant, please contact the Oregon State University Institutional Review Board (IRB) Office, at (541) 737-8008 or by email at IRB@oregonstate.edu.

Bad labels will have a similar effect, a common label that help a lot new developers is the “good first issue”, so when someone see’s it they will be more confident to work on it, and them evolving to more complex issues later. Process is also something that can be vary overwhelming.

Documentations is always important to help people out, but in this context I believe that is a nice to have but not fundamental, same goes for good communication, usually people only uses the issue to talk about the project, some fancy ones with a big user base like ISH app or Golang have a discord or slack server where people can go and talk about suggestions or problems they are facing but in my experience the communication regarding issues stays on the issue it self.
